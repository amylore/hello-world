Hello, Github!

I'm a total newbie - I just started attending a code school in Portland, OR. I'm not even sure what languages I like to use yet, but I'm looking forward to exploring Github and seeing what I can help with!

I like pinball, my '91 BMW e30, coffee ice cream, and reading on the river. I believe you can never have too many sweaters or too much yarn.
